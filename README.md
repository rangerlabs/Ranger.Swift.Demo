# Ranger.Swift.Demo

This demo application is intended for users of Ranger Lab's SaaS platform. It provides a conceptual understanding of geofencing, facilitates testing of geofences, and provides a starting point for developers looking to integration Ranger's server-side geofencing capabilities with their app.

The app utilizes the Ranger.Swift.TrackerV1, which forwards Breadcrumbs to the Ranger servers once configured. The app can also be configured to receive real-time Geofence events from Ranger with a valid Pusher Channels configuration. The Pusher Channels integration is required to be set up for your Ranger account.
